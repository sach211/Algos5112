  # `graph` is an object that provides a get_neighbors(node) method that returns
  # a list of (node, weight) edges. both of your graph implementations should be
  # valid inputs. you may assume that the input graph is connected, and that all
  # edges in the graph have positive edge weights.
  # 
  # `source` and `target` are both nodes in the input graph. you may assume that
  # at least one path exists from the source node to the target node.
  #
  # this method should return a tuple that looks like
  # ([`source`, ..., `target`], `length`), where the first element is a list of
  # nodes representing the shortest path from the source to the target (in
  # order) and the second element is the length of that path
  #
  # NOTE: Please see instructions.txt for additional information about the
  # return value of this method.
